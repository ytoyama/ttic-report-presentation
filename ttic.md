# Internship at TTIC

## Who?

- Yota Toyama
- 1st-year master student
- Computational Intelligence Laboratory
- Professors
  - Mr. Sasaki
  - Mr. Miwa
- Research interests
  - Natural language processing
  - Machine learning
    - I went to TTIC to take a the Machine learning class and do some research.


## Where?

- I had been studying at TTIC from September to December.
- TTIC
  - in Chicago, Illinoi state, the US
- O'hare airport
  - You can take shuttles or buses at the airport to go to TTIC
- Michigan lake
- Downtown
- Don't go to the south side of TTIC at night. It's unsafe.

- The building where TTIC resides
  - It's located inside the campus of University of Chicago
- TTIC has 4th to 5th floors of this building.


## Food

- This is one of the most famous Chicago foods, deep dish pizza.
  - Very thick
  - Most of the stuff in the pie is just cheeze.
  - Very American food
- I could have only two slices and brought back the rest.


## Cars

- I like cars.
- Do you know what this car is?
  - T
  - Not Toyota
  - Tesla
  - While they are expensive (around 8 million yen), there are many Teslas in Chicago.


## Downtown

- The cloud gate
  - Some people call it "Bean" because of its shape.
  - It was much bigger than I thought.
- You can see some tranditional-style buildings in the downtown.
  - That's different from Nagoya.


## School

- In TTIC, you will be allocated a cubicle.
  - Where you do some work.
  - Homework and research
- Most of them are used by students.
- Professors have their own rooms.

- Many whiteboards
  - Good environment for research
  - You can discuss about research in the school.


## Class

- I took a class of Machine learning.
- The style of classes are almost the same as in Japan.
- There were some programming competitions as part of homework.
- Kaggle's web page used for the machine learning class
- Kaggle
  - The service to hold competitions mainly for machine learning or data science
  - You submit your programs as your solutions to this competition system.
  - The competition of the last homework
  - You can see the ranking.
  - I could win the first prize.
- TTIC has some connections with University of Chicago.
  - You can also take classes of University of Chicago if you want.
  - There are also some interesting classes on computer science.


## Research

- I also did some research work with my advisor, David.
- In TTIC, I worked on a task of Question answering.
- Question answering
  - Especially Cloze-style question task
  - In Cloze-style questions, you need to answer what the most appropriate
    answer should be in the blank.

- Model with attention mechanism
  - Attention mechanism lets deep learning models focus on something important.


## Demo

[Demo](https://asciinema.org/a/93469)

- The last paper I mentioned is about a deep learning model.
- Training deep learning models takes much computational cost.
- Two clusters which consists of many powerful computers.
- You can use it like one computer to train them.
  - That should boost your research cycle.
- It is a very good research environment.


## Conclusion

- You should go.
  - You can learn much about Machine learning from basics to its application.
  - If you are interested in Computer Science, especially in Machine learning.
  - You can also improve your speaking and listening skill in English.
- Consider staying for 6 months or longer if you want to achieve something new
  in your research there.
